Simple Gradle library project to illustrate challenges with the sync process when there are failures due to api changes.

The build works fine with Gradle 8.12.1, but fails with Gradle 8.13.
The test suite property `testType` has been removed and effectively needs to be commented out.

It is present in 3 locations, to observe different effects and impact.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Import the project in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Confirm everything works
3. Bump the wrapper version to 8.13
4. Sync the project
5. Observe the failure

## Failures

In all cases, if you go to the file failing the build, you will not see anything highlighted as an error.
This is because the IDE still has the old 8.12.1 Gradle API and the code assistant believes the file content is correct.
You can also see that typing `test` and then hitting the completion shortcut will offer `testType` as a completion option.

Failure locations:

* `gradle/build-logic/build.gradle.kts`
* `gradle/build-logic/src/main/kotlin/custom.gradle.kts`
* `lib/build.gradle.kts`
